# Portfolio-Management

In this repository, you will find a credit portfolio modeling with Monte Carlo simulation based method for the computation of credit-portfolio loss-distributions  and  for  the  estimation  of  various  risk  measures. 
Four principal risk measures  are taken into account : Value At Risk (VaR), Expected Shortfall (ES),  Expected  Loss  (EL)  and  Unexpected  Loss  (UL). 
The notebook also includes credit derivatives which are synthetic contracts to buy or sell protection  against  credit-related  losses.   
There's also an  interactive dashboard allowing you to choose parameters for your credit portfolio modeling
